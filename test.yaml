            Also known as a Correlation ID, is a unique identifier value that is attached to requests and Notifications that allow reference to a particular business transaction or event chain across multiple integration tiers. 
            x-b3-traceid header is automatically generated/passed through when Spring Cloud Sleuth is included as a dependency. Sleuth is a transitive dependency of Chassis. 
            If project team needs to create trace id  their own , it has to be 16 digit hexadecimal number(64 bit, since digit in hexadecimal represents 4 bits) e.g. 71200de3d3f82a83 as supported by Chassis.          
        example: "41200de3d3e82a81"

        description: |
            This header represents root span id. The span represents a basic unit of work.  Span is the primary building block of a distributed trace, representing an individual unit of work done in a distributed system. Spans will contain �References� to other spans, which allows multiple Spans to be assembled into one complete Trace - a visualization of the life of a request as it moves through a distributed system.
            The trace id (x-b3-traceid) contains a set of span ids, forming a tree-like structure. The trace id will remain the same as one micro service calls the next. Spans have parent-child relationships. This span id creates parent-child relationship with the child spans to generate a trace tree out of all the spans for a request. If project team needs to create span id  their own , it has to be 16 digit hexadecimal number(64 bit, since digit in hexadecimal represents 4 bits) e.g. 71200de3d3f82a83 as supported by Chassis.

            This is to identify the Channel which is making this request. Originating application is responsible for sending x-channel-id. 
            For example, if  application 1 makes call to application 2 and then application 2 makes a call to application 3, application 1 will populate and send the x-channel-id to application 2 and application 2 will propagate the same x-channel-id to application 3.
